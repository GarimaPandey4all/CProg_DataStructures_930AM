Hashing(O(1)average case) vs Tries(O(1)best case):

Advantages:
1. It is faster than hashing because of the ways it is implemented. we do not compute  any hash function. No collision handling is required.

2. We can easily print all words in alphabetical order which is not easily possible with hashing.

3. We can efficiently do prefix search with trie.

Disadvantages:

1. A lot of memory required for storing the strinds, because od each node have too many node pointers.
